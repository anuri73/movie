# A movie recommendation system built using Scala, Spark and Hadoop

Recommendation system is a widely used machine learning technique that has many applications in E-commerce (Amazon, Alibaba), video streaming (Netflix, Disney+), social network (Facebook, Linkedin) and many other areas. Because of the large amount of data in those services, nowadays most of industry-level recommendation systems are built in big data frameworks like Spark and Hadoop. So in this repository I want to make a movie recomendation system using Scala, Spark and Hadoop.
